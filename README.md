# NAS-Benchmark

This repository includes the code used to evaluate NAS methods on 5 different datasets, as well as the code used to augment architectures with different protocols, as mentioned in our ICLR 2020 paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12522). Scripts examples are provided in each folder.

## ICLR 2020 video poster presentation
The video from our ICLR 2020 poster presentation is available at https://iclr.cc/virtual_2020/poster_HygrdpVKvr.html.

## Plots
All code used to generate the plots of the paper can be found in the "Plots" folder.

## Randomly Sampled Architectures
You can find all sampled architectures and corresponding training logs in Plots\data\modified_search_space.

## Data

In the data folder, you will find the data splits for Sport-8, MIT-67 and Flowers-102 in .csv files.

You can download these datasets on the following web sites :

Sport-8: http://vision.stanford.edu/lijiali/event_dataset/

MIT-67: http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/indoor.html

Flowers-102: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/

The data path has to be set the following way: dataset/train/classes/images for the training set, dataset/test/classes/images for the test set.

For the two following methods, we have not yet performed consistent experiments (therefore the methods are not included in the paper). Nonetheless, we provide runnable code that could provide relevant insights (similar to those provided in the paper on the other methods) on these methods.
